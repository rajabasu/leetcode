### Explanation:

**`isAnagram` (Using one frequency map)**

This is a more space-efficient variation.

1.  **Length Check**: Same as the first method. If lengths differ, return `false`.
2.  **Single Character Frequency Map**:
    - One JavaScript object, `charCounts`, is created.
    - **Populate from `s`**: Iterate through string `s`. For each character, increment its count in `charCounts`.
    - **Decrement from `t`**: Iterate through string `t`. For each character:
      - If the character is not found in `charCounts` (i.e., `!charCounts[char]` is true, meaning its count is 0 or it was never in `s`), then `t` has a character not in `s` or has it more times than `s`. Return `false`.
      - Otherwise, decrement the count of that character in `charCounts`.
3.  **Return True**: If the second loop (decrementing for `t`) completes without returning `false`, it means every character in `t` was accounted for by a character in `s`, and their frequencies matched. Thus, they are anagrams.

### Complexity Analysis (for both methods):

- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$

  - Where $N$ is the length of the strings (assuming `s.length === t.length`).
  - The process involves iterating through the strings a constant number of times (once or twice to build the frequency map(s), and once to compare or decrement).
  - Accessing and updating properties in a JavaScript object (used as a hash map) takes, on average, $O(1)$ time.
  - If the alphabet size is considered constant (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters), iterating through the map keys would also be $O(1)$ in that context. However, for arbitrary strings, the number of unique characters could be up to $N$. The dominant factor is iterating through the strings themselves.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **`isAnagram` (two maps)**: $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of unique characters in the strings (or the size of the character set, e.g., ASCII, Unicode). In the worst case, if all characters are unique, $k$ could be up to $N$. So, it's often stated as $O(N)$ or $O(k)$ where $k \le N$.
  - **`isAnagramOptimized` (one map)**: Also $O(k)$ for the same reasons.

Both methods are efficient for solving the anagram problem. The single-map version is slightly more optimized in terms of the constant factors for space but maintains the same asymptotic complexity. The problem statement usually implies case-sensitivity. If case-insensitivity is required, you would convert both strings to lowercase before processing.
